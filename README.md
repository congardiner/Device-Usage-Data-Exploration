# Overview

Welcome! This is a personal data analysis initiative that I created to assess the potential influences of mobile device usage in the United States and User Behavior which also intently includes key insights into sales tactics, market trends, and consumer impact on the handheld market as a whole. It is important to denote that this is not a commercial project, nor is it completely representative of the entire mobile device market as accessible data is limited to what I could find in locally populated datasets. It is anticipated that this analysis will be updated in the future as more data becomes available, and as new questions arise from my reported findings.

# Data Analysis Results

The analysis conducted on the datasets provided insights into various aspects of mobile device usage and user behavior. Here are some of the key questions addressed and the findings I derived from the analysis:

- What are the top selling manufacturers for mobile devices in the World by total gross sales?

- What are trends in specifications of mobile devices over the years and how do they affect sales?

- What are some of the influences of mobile device usage in the United States and User Behavior? What ages are using the most screen on usage per day; is there a dominating phone model, os, and gender where this is more pronounced?

The results are included within the official-post.qmd file, with a directed focus on showcasing the data exploration phase, techniques utilized for visualization and the results as indicated from the report. The analysis includes visualizations, statistical summaries, and insights derived from the (4) datasets that were used. 

It is imperative to denote that this analysis is not exhaustive, and is based on the datasets that were available at the time of this project; therefore, it is not representative of the entire mobile device market. The analysis is intended to provide insights into the mobile device market and user behavior based on the available data.

The ideal would be to expand this analysis with more datasets, specifically with those that include demographic data, sales data, and specifications of devices with granular details. In addition to this, the requirements for GDPR compliance and data privacy should be considered as I wouldn't want to violate any standing regulations. In the instance of a distributor or manufacturer, this aspect of Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and Research and Development (R&D) would be extremely beneficial to the mobile device market as a whole.

# Future Work

* Add more datasets to improve the analysis (ie, demographic, sales data, specifications of devices with granular details, etc), specifically with the intent to buildout a model to predict future trends in the mobile device market.
* An interactive dashboard or web application to visualize the data and findings would be extremely beneficial, something that I definitely want to work on to add to this project.
* Implement a more robust data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the datasets as well include interactive visualizations to better understand the data; research will be required to determine the best approach for this.
* Incorporate a machine learning model (ie, XGBOOST, Decision-Tree, or Neural Network) to predict future trends in mobile device usage and sales; user behavior is tricky due to target demographics but this would be a great addition if publically available to scale. 
* Continuation of expanding the current datasets, aided with further data exploration could yield more insights into both the mobile device market and user behavior.
